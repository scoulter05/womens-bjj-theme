## Finding Your Tribe in Jiu-Jitsu

If you're new to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or looking for a supportive community of women to train with, let me introduce you to something special—**GLOSS (Grappling Ladies of Southeastern States)**. Whether you’re just starting your journey or already deep into training, this group is a game-changer for women in grappling.

Jiu-jitsu can feel intimidating at first. Walking into a gym full of experienced practitioners, trying to remember techniques, and rolling with people twice your size can be overwhelming. But finding a community that lifts you up, encourages you, and shares in your victories—both big and small—makes all the difference. That’s exactly what GLOSS does. It’s more than just a training group; it’s a sisterhood.

## What is GLOSS?

GLOSS is a community of female grapplers from all over the southeastern United States who support each other through open mat events, training meet-ups, and even scholarships to help women compete at major tournaments. It’s a safe and welcoming space where women of all skill levels can roll together, learn, and grow—both on and off the mats.

## Support That Goes Beyond the Mats

One of the most amazing things about GLOSS is how deeply it supports women in the sport. It’s not just about learning arm bars and sweeps; it’s about fostering friendships, mentorship, and opportunities that help women succeed.

I experienced this firsthand when I was chosen for the GLOSS scholarship. Competing in tournaments can be expensive—travel, registration fees, and training costs add up fast. Thanks to the support from GLOSS, I was able to travel to **Las Vegas for the 2024 ADCC Trials**. Competing on such a huge stage was both nerve-wracking and exhilarating, but knowing I had a community of women cheering me on gave me the confidence I needed. I pushed myself harder than ever, and it paid off—I placed **third at ADCC Open!** The experience was unforgettable, and it wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible support from GLOSS.

## Training, Traveling, and Learning Together

One of the best parts of being in GLOSS is the sheer **fun** of it. Training is serious, but it’s also about enjoying the process, meeting amazing people, and traveling to train with new partners. GLOSS hosts **open mats and events all over the Southeast**, where women from different gyms come together to share knowledge and sharpen their skills.

Imagine spending a weekend with a group of badass women, rolling, laughing, and learning from each other. There’s something special about training in a room full of people who truly understand your journey, who push you to be better while celebrating every little victory along the way. It’s about **empowerment, not ego**—and that’s what makes GLOSS so unique.

## A Welcoming Space for Newcomers

If you’re new to jiu-jitsu, GLOSS is the perfect place to start finding your rhythm. Everyone remembers what it’s like to be the only woman in a class full of guys, feeling like you have so much to learn. But with GLOSS, you’re never alone. The women in this group have been where you are, and they are more than happy to share advice, drills, and techniques to help you improve.

And don’t worry—you don’t need to be a competitor to join! Whether you train for self-defense, fitness, or just because you love it, there’s a place for you in GLOSS.
